## Summary

This project focuses on Multilingual Speech Emotion Recognition (SER), covering languages such as English, Chinese, German, French, and Italian. By leveraging diverse linguistic datasets, the goal is to develop a robust SER model capable of accurately detecting and classifying emotions across these languages.

## Description

The project involves implementing advanced machine learning techniques to achieve Multilingual SER. It includes data collection from diverse sources, preprocessing for language-specific nuances, and training models that can generalize across multiple languages. 

<!-- 
### Project Phases

- **Data Collection**: Gather speech datasets in English, Chinese, German, French, and Italian.
- **Preprocessing**: Normalize and preprocess data to account for linguistic variations.
- **Model Training**: Implement and fine-tune SER models using multilingual techniques.
- **Evaluation**: Assess model performance across different languages using standard metrics.

### Diagrams

Include architectural diagrams depicting data flow, preprocessing steps, and model architecture.

### Approaches

Utilize transfer learning, deep learning architectures tailored for multilingual applications, and ensemble methods for improved SER performance.
